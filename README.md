This is my first react project - Spinning wheel which generates coupons when a payment is done. [Demo](https://github.com/manasa9595/gamification/blob/main/DEMO%20Spinning%20wheel.mp4)

##### IDEA: The strategy involves leveraging the dual appeal of gaming and savings through coupons to engage and retain users. 


## Project Setup
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
